h2. Other Check Implementation

* All pictures that appears in a Scout page should be in the “Scout Image” category
* No link to a redirection page.
* Old pages (e.g 3.7 tutorials) needs to contain a special template to mention that the content of the page is old, and that there is a newer version.
* Link from an version-dependent page (e.g. matching "Scout/*/3.7/*") to an other version-dependent page should be in the same version.
* Link from a not version dependent page to an other version-dependent page should use the "ScoutCurrentVersion" template: @[[Scout/HowTo/{{ScoutCurrentVersion}}/Add_an_icon|How to add an icon ?]]@
* @<br clear="all" />@ is not supported by the converter tool: warning if used
* @<code>xxx</CODE>@ is not supported by the converter tool: should be @<code>xxx</code>@.
